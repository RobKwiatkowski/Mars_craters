# Mars_craters
This is a python script for statistical analysis of Mars craters. Data are taken from an open database available in the Internet.
The statistics here include a distribution density of craters in a function of latitude.

For this calculations Mars is assumed as an ideal sphere in order to simplify latitude sections area equations (to use spherical cap equations).
