# Analysis of craters on Mars

This is a python script for statistical analysis of Mars craters. Data are taken from an open database available in the Internet.
The statistics here include a density distribution of craters in a function of latitude. For this calculation Mars is assumed as an ideal sphere in order to simplify calculations of latitude sections area (to use the spherical cap equation).
